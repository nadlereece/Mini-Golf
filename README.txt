--------------------------------------------------- How to Play ---------------------------------------------------

   Use the mouse to aim in the direction you'd like to hit the ball, then press and hold the left mouse button to
charge up the power of your shot (shortest line is lowest power, longest line is most power), then release to send
  the ball flying! Pars for each course are 3, 4, and 5 respectively, and the number of strokes are listed in the
					top right corner. Happy playing!
